The history of every major galactic civilization tends to pass through three
distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication,
otherwise known as the How, Why, and Where phases. For instance, the first phase
is characterized by the question ‘How can we eat?’, the second by the question
‘Why do we eat?’ and the third by the question, ‘Where shall we have lunch?’

(Douglas Adams, “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy“)

One can roughly divide mathematical education into three stages:

1. The “pre-rigorous” stage, in which mathematics is taught in an informal,
   intuitive manner, based on examples, fuzzy notions, and hand-waving. (For
   instance, calculus is usually first introduced in terms of slopes, areas,
   rates of change, and so forth.) The emphasis is more on computation than on
   theory. This stage generally lasts until the early undergraduate years.
2. The “rigorous” stage, in which one is now taught that in order to do maths
   “properly”, one needs to work and think in a much more precise and formal
   manner (e.g. re-doing calculus by using epsilons and deltas all over the
   place). The emphasis is now primarily on theory; and one is expected to be
   able to comfortably manipulate abstract mathematical objects without focusing
   too much on what such objects actually “mean”. This stage usually occupies
   the later undergraduate and early graduate years.
3. The “post-rigorous” stage, in which one has grown comfortable with all the
   rigorous foundations of one’s chosen field, and is now ready to revisit and
   refine one’s pre-rigorous intuition on the subject, but this time with the
   intuition solidly buttressed by rigorous theory. (For instance, in this stage
   one would be able to quickly and accurately perform computations in vector
   calculus by using analogies with scalar calculus, or informal and
   semi-rigorous use of infinitesimals, big-O notation, and so forth, and be
   able to convert all such calculations into a rigorous argument whenever
   required.) The emphasis is now on applications, intuition, and the “big
   picture”. This stage usually occupies the late graduate years and beyond.

The transition from the first stage to the second is well known to be rather
traumatic, with the dreaded “proof-type questions” being the bane of many a
maths undergraduate. (See also [“There’s more to maths than grades and exams and
methods“](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-grades-and-exams-and-methods/).)
But the transition from the second to the third is equally important, and should
not be forgotten.

It is of course vitally important that you know how to think rigorously, as this
gives you the discipline to avoid many common errors and purge many
misconceptions. Unfortunately, this has the unintended consequence that
“fuzzier” or “intuitive” thinking (such as heuristic reasoning, judicious
extrapolation from examples, or analogies with other contexts such as physics)
gets deprecated as “non-rigorous”. All too often, one ends up discarding one’s
initial intuition and is only able to process mathematics at a formal level,
thus getting stalled at the second stage of one’s mathematical education.
(Among other things, this can impact one’s ability to read mathematical papers;
an overly literal mindset can lead to “compilation errors” when one encounters
even a single typo or ambiguity in such a paper.)

The point of rigour is not to destroy all intuition; instead, it should be used
to destroy bad intuition while clarifying and elevating good intuition. It is
only with a combination of both rigorous formalism and good intuition that one
can tackle complex mathematical problems; one needs the former to correctly deal
with the fine details, and the latter to correctly deal with the big
picture. Without one or the other, you will spend a lot of time blundering
around in the dark (which can be instructive, but is highly inefficient). So
once you are fully comfortable with rigorous mathematical thinking, you should
revisit your intuitions on the subject and use your new thinking skills to test
and refine these intuitions rather than discard them. One way to do this is to
ask yourself dumb questions; another is to relearn your field.

The ideal state to reach is when every heuristic argument naturally suggests its
rigorous counterpart, and vice versa. Then you will be able to tackle maths
problems by using both halves of your brain at once – i.e., the same way you
already tackle problems in “real life”.

Added later: It is perhaps worth noting that mathematicians at all three of the
above stages of mathematical development can still make formal mistakes in their
mathematical writing.  However, the nature of these mistakes tends to be rather
different, depending on what stage one is at:

1. Mathematicians at the pre-rigorous stage of development often make formal
   errors because they are unable to understand how the rigorous mathematical
   formalism actually works, and are instead applying formal rules or heuristics
   blindly.  It can often be quite difficult for such mathematicians to
   appreciate and correct these errors even when those errors are explicitly
   pointed out to them.
2. Mathematicians at the rigorous stage of development can still make formal
   errors because they have not yet perfected their formal understanding, or are
   unable to perform enough “sanity checks” against intuition or other rules of
   thumb to catch, say, a sign error, or a failure to correctly verify a crucial
   hypothesis in a tool.  However, such errors can usually be detected (and
   often repaired) once they are pointed out to them.
3. Mathematicians at the post-rigorous stage of development are not infallible,
   and are still capable of making formal errors in their writing.  But this is
   often because they no longer need the formalism in order to perform
   high-level mathematical reasoning, and are actually proceeding largely
   through intuition, which is then translated (possibly incorrectly) into
   formal mathematical language.

The distinction between the three types of errors can lead to the phenomenon
(which can often be quite puzzling to readers at earlier stages of mathematical
development) of a mathematical argument by a post-rigorous mathematician which
locally contains a number of typos and other formal errors, but is globally
quite sound, with the local errors propagating for a while before being
cancelled out by other local errors.  (In contrast, when unchecked by a solid
intuition, once an error is introduced in an argument by a pre-rigorous or
rigorous mathematician, it is possible for the error to propagate out of control
until one is left with complete nonsense at the end of the argument.)  See this
post for some further discussion of such errors, and how to read papers to
compensate for them.

I discuss this topic further in this video with Brady “Numberphile” Haran.

Computers are notorious for interpreting language in an overly literal fashion;
a single misplaced parenthesis in an otherwise flawless piece of software code
can cause a computer to halt in utter incomprehension halfway through the
compilation of that code.

Humans, when reading natural language, tend to be far more robust at this; once
one is fluent in, say, English, one can usually deal with a reasonable number of
spelling or grammatical errors in a text, particularly when the writing style is
clear and organised, and the themes of the text are familiar to the reader.

However, when, as a graduate student, one encounters the task of reading a
technical mathematical paper for the first time, it is often the case that one
loses much of one's higher reading skills, reverting instead to a more formal
and tedious line-by-line interpretation of the text. As a consequence, a single
typo or undefined term in the paper can cause one's comprehension of the paper
to grind to a complete halt, in much the same way that it would to a computer.

In many cases, such "compilation errors" can be resolved simply by reading ahead
in the paper. In some cases, just reading the next one or two lines can shed a
lot of light on the mysterious term that was just introduced, or the unexplained
step in the logic. In other cases, one has to read a fair bit further ahead; if,
for instance, the conclusion of Lemma 15 was difficult to understand, one can
read ahead to the end of the proof of that Lemma (in which, presumably, the
conclusion is obtained), or search ahead to, say, Proposition 23, in which Lemma
15 is invoked, to get more clues as to what Lemma 15 is trying to say. (The use
of search functions in, say, a PDF reader, is particularly useful in this
regard.)

It is also good to keep in mind that no author is infallible, and that in some
cases, the simplest explanation for incomprehension is that there is a typo in
the text. For instance, suppose a paper states that "Since A is true, B is
true", but when one works things out, one cannot quite deduce B from A, but
instead can only achieve a slightly different conclusion B'. A bit later on in
the text, the paper states that "Since B is true, then C is true", but again one
has difficulty deducing C from B. Here, the most likely diagnosis is that the
author actually meant to write B' instead of B in both places.

In a similar spirit, if the paper contains a cryptic comment which you didn't
quite understand, but chose to ignore in order to move on, and then two lines
later you find a deduction of a conclusion which you don't see to be a
consequence of the previous statements, then one should go back to the cryptic
comment and parse it very carefully, as it is likely to be a description of the
missing hypothesis or technique needed to reach the stated conclusion.

Sometimes one has to look for the absence of key words, rather than their
presence.  Suppose for instance the statement A is asserted in a paper, followed
shortly by a statement B.  You understand how A is deduced, but you see no way
to use A to derive B.  But were there key words such as "thus", "therefore", or
"consequently" that actually indicated that A was to be used to derive B?  If
not, then what is likely happening here is that B is being derived from some
other source than A, and a rereading of the text near or immediately preceding A
and B with this in mind may then reveal how B is to be established.

Another useful trick is to "project" the paper down to a simpler and shorter
paper by restricting attention to a simpler special case, or by adopting some
heuristic that allows one to trivialise some technical portions of the paper (or
at least make some steps of the paper plausible enough to the reader that one is
willing to skip over the details of proof for those steps). For instance, if the
paper is dealing with a result in general dimension, one might first specialise
the paper to one dimension (even if this means that the main results are no
longer new, but consequences of previous literature). Or, if the paper has to
analyse both the main term in an expression as well as error terms, one can
adopt the heuristic that all error terms are negligible and only focus on the
main term (or dually, one can accept that the main term is always going to
compute out to the correct answer, and only focus on controlling error
terms). If one is aware of a near-counterexample to the main result,
specialising the paper to that near-counterexample (or to a hypothetical
perturbation of that near-counterexample that is trying to be a genuine
counterexample) is often quite instructive. Ideally, one should project away
roughly half of the difficulties of the paper, leaving behind a paper which is
twice as simple, and thus presumably much easier to understand; once this is
done, one can undo the projection, and return to the original paper, which is
now already half understood, and again much easier to understand than before one
understood the projected paper. (The difficulty of reading a paper usually
increases in a super-linear fashion with the complexity of the paper, so
factoring the paper into two sub-papers, each with half the complexity, is often
an efficient way to proceed.)

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, reading becomes much easier when one can
somehow "get into the author's head", and get a sense of what the author is
trying to do with each statement or lemma in the paper, rather than focusing
purely on the literal statements in the text. A good author will interleave the
mathematical text with commentary that is designed to do exactly this, but even
without such explicit clues, one can often get a sense of the purpose of each
component of the paper by comparing it with similar components in other papers,
or by seeing how such a component is used in the rest of the paper. In extreme
cases, one may have to go to a large blackboard and diagram all the logical
dependencies of a paper (e.g. if Lemma 6 and Lemma 8 are used to prove Theorem
10, one can draw arrows between boxes bearing these names accordingly) to get
some sense of what the key steps in the paper are.
